# Inter-Semi-Spinal Block Efficacy and Safety Analysis

Statistical analysis comparing the efficacy of ISSP (Intrathecal Spinal Space) Block versus standard control in postoperative pain management. This R project analyzes data from 44 patients, evaluating pain scores, opioid consumption, and adverse events.

## Key Analyses

- **Statistical Tests**: Shapiro-Wilk normality testing, Mann-Whitney U test, Chi-squared/Fisher exact tests
- **Survival Analysis**: Kaplan-Meier curves for time to first rescue analgesic administration
- **Pain Assessment**: Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) tracking across 48-hour postoperative period
- **Multiple Testing Correction**: Bonferroni correction applied to VAS comparisons
